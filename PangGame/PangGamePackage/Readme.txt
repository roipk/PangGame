## Remarks

I had a positive experience working on the exercise. Initially, I attempted to connect to a server for a multiplayer game. 
However, I realized that it was taking more time than I had anticipated. 
In order to make the most of my time, I decided to shift my focus towards completing the single-player exercise instead. 
This allowed me to efficiently manage my time and ensure that I successfully finished a part of the project.
